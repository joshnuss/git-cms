git-cms
----------

A CMS for developers.

# Features

- Content is stored in `.json` or `.yml` files.
- Reading content is done via an `http` API. Works for SSG, SSR & SPA sites.
- Changes are broadcasted through a `WebSocket` interface. That means even SSG sites can react to content changes.
- Editing uses a standard git-based workflow of PRs, reviews, approvals and merging.
- Content is stored a standard git repo, no vendor lock-in with proprietary data formats.
